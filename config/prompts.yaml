# System Prompts Configuration
# ============================================================================
#
# This file contains the default prompts used by the chat assistant.
# These prompts are loaded into the database when you first run init_database.py
#
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: After initial setup, changes here WON'T automatically update
#    the running app! The database is the source of truth.
#
# 💡 TO UPDATE PROMPTS:
#    Option 1: Use the Settings UI in the app (recommended)
#    Option 2: Update database directly:
#              UPDATE prompts SET system_prompt = '...' WHERE profile_id = 1;
#    Option 3: Delete database and re-run init_database.py (nuclear option)
#

# System Prompt
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This defines your AI assistant's personality, behavior, and capabilities.
# The system prompt is sent with EVERY user message to provide context.
#
# 🎯 WHAT TO INCLUDE:
#    - Who the AI is (role/personality)
#    - What it can/can't do
#    - How it should format responses
#    - Any domain-specific knowledge or constraints
#
# 💡 CUSTOMIZATION EXAMPLES:
#
#    Customer Support Bot:
#      "You are a customer support agent for Acme Corp. You help with orders,
#       returns, and product questions. Always be polite and solution-oriented."
#
#    Data Analyst Assistant:
#      "You are a data analyst who writes SQL queries and explains insights.
#       You have access to: customers, orders, products tables."
#
#    Code Review Assistant:
#      "You are a senior software engineer. Review code for: security issues,
#       performance problems, best practices violations."
#
# ⚠️ BEST PRACTICES:
#    - Be specific about the role and capabilities
#    - Include formatting instructions (markdown, code blocks, etc.)
#    - Keep it concise (100-300 words typically)
#    - Test changes with various user questions
#
# 📏 LENGTH: Most models work best with 100-500 words
#            Too short = generic responses
#            Too long = may get ignored or truncated

  You are a helpful AI assistant powered by Databricks. You provide clear, accurate,
  and concise responses to user questions.

  Format your responses using markdown for better readability:
  - Use **bold** for emphasis
  - Use bullet points for lists
  - Use code blocks with syntax highlighting for code snippets
  - Use headings to organize longer responses

  Be friendly, professional, and helpful. If you don't know something, admit it
  rather than making up information.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# User Prompt Template
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This template wraps each user message before sending to the model.
# Use {question} as a placeholder for the actual user input.
#
# 💡 USE CASES:
#
#    Add Context:
#      "Context: We are a financial services company.\nQuestion: {question}"
#
#    Add Instructions:
#      "Answer the following question concisely:\n{question}"
#
#    Add Constraints:
#      "Question: {question}\nProvide answer in 3 bullet points or less."
#
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT:
#    - Must include {question} placeholder (will be replaced with user input)
#    - Keep it simple for most use cases - just "{question}" works fine
#    - Complex templates can confuse the model
#
# 🎯 DEFAULT: "{question}" - Simple passthrough (recommended for most cases)
#
